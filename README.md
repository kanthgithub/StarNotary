# ERC721 Star Notarization Tokens

An ERC721 Non-fungible token to claim ownership of the stars in the sky

# Implementations in this project.

Add Smart Contract Functions: 

- Add a name and a symbol to the starNotary tokens.
- Add a function ```js lookUptokenIdToStarInfo ```, that looks up the stars using the Token ID, and then returns the name of the star.
- Add a function called ```js exchangeStars ```, so 2 users can exchange their star tokens. Do not worry about the price, just write code to exchange stars between users.
- Write a function to Transfer a Star. The function should transfer a star from the address of the caller. The function should accept 2 arguments, the address to transfer the star to, and the token ID of the star.

Add supporting Unit Tests:

- The token name and token symbol are added properly.
- 2 users can exchange their stars.
- Stars Tokens can be transferred from one address to another.

Deploy your Contract to Rinkeby:

- truffle.config file should have settings to deploy the contract to the Rinkeby Public Network.
- Infura should be used in the truffle.config file for deployment to Rinkeby.

Modify the front end of the DAPP:
- Create and functions to create new Star and Look up Star information with Star ID.
